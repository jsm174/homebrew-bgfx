# Homebrew bgfx

This repo is a Homebrew tap containing the following:

- bgfx Formula
- LunarG Vulkan SDK Cask

`bgfx` was adapted from [piermorel/homebrew-bgfx](https://github.com/piermorel/homebrew-bgfx) and
uses [bgfx.cmake](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.cmake).

`vulkan-sdk` was inspired by [homebrew-vulkan](https://github.com/apenngrace/homebrew-vulkan) but uses 
the LunarG Installer in [terminal](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.2.189.0/mac/getting_started.html) mode.
