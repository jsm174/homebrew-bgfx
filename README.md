# Homebrew bgfx

This repo contains a cask for installing the LunarG Vulkan SDK and bgfx via cmake.

`vulkan-sdk` cask was inspired by [homebrew-vulkan](https://github.com/apenngrace/homebrew-vulkan) but uses 
the LunarG Installer in [terminal](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.2.189.0/mac/getting_started.html) mode.
